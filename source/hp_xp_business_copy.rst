HP XP Business Copy
===================

HP XP Business Copy Software is a local replication solution that provides data copies within a single HP XP Disk Array or in storage systems attached to an XP Disk Array as external storage. HP XP Business Copy Software uses array-based replication technologies that do not interfere with host-level operations, allowing customers to spend time conducting business rather than worrying about how backup and testing operations will impact your systems.
Providing both snapshots and mirrors, HP XP Business Copy Software reduces the cost of backups, accelerates recovery from failures, provides deployment flexibility, and simplifies application testing. HP XP Business Copy Software can create full copies in physically separate locations within the array so that accesses to the copy will have no impact on the original production volume. In addition, you can use the space-efficient snapshot capability to create frequent point-in-time copies of important volumes so that you can quickly restore data to an earlier version if necessary.
